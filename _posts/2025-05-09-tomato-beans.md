Live love laugh beans

### Ingredients:

Per ~2-3 servings.

* 2 15oz cans of white beans, rinsed and drained (I like butter or cannellini beans for this one usually)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon chili flakes
* 1/3 cup tomato paste
* 3/4 cup unsweetened milk (I used soy)
* 1/4 cup vegan heavy cream (I use [this](https://silk.com/plant-based-products/creamer/dairy-free-heavy-whipping-cream-alternative/) one
* 6 oz spinach
* Handful of fresh parsley
* olive oil, as much as needed
* vegan parmesan, to garnish (optional)
* vegan feta (optional)
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

* In a pot, heat some olive oil (~2 tablespoons-ish), and add the garlic and chili flakes. Add the tomato paste and mix until combined. Add the milk slowly, mixing to incorporate within the tomato paste in between each addition. Add the heavy cream and mix to combine. Add the spinach and mix until wilted.
