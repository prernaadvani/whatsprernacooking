Happy mango season to all those that celebrate

### Ingredients:

Per ~3-4 servings.

* 2 15oz cans black beans, drained and rinsed
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 green bell pepper, diced
* 1 red bell pepper, diced
* 1 large tomato, slced (I used a beefsteak tomato)
* 1/2 tablespoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon aleppo peppers (optional)
* 1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
* 4-5 green onions, chopped
* 1.5 tablespoons butter
* 2 cups corn
* 1/2 lime
* 1 cucumber, diced
* 1 mango, cut into cubes
* 8oz greens of choice
* 1/4 cup guasacaca (or sub with guacamole)
* 1/3 cup Trader Joe's pepita salsa
* vegan feta, as a garnish (optional)
* olive oil, as much as needed
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

* In a pot, heat some olive oil (~2 tablespoons-ish), and add the garlic. Once fragrant, add the bell peppers and give it a stir. Then add the tomatoes along with the cumin and aleppo peppers, if using. Saute for a couple of minutes. Then, add the black beans to the po (I like to mash some of them up to help thicken the consistency) along with ~1/2 cup water. Add the green onions and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Once this comes to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and let it sit for around 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more water if needed.

* Separately, in a pan, add the butter and once melted, add the corn. Add some salt and pepper, to taste. Let the corn roast, stirring occasionally, for around 15 minutes. I like to add a handful of cilantro in the corn as well (optional). When the corn is roasted and toasted, finish by squeezing the lime on top.

* Assemble all your ingredients for the bowl (cucumber, mango, greens, guasacaca/guacamole, pepita salsa (if using):
