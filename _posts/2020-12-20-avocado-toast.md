I eat this for at least 4 meals per week. I wish I was kidding.


### Ingredients:

Ingredients listed are for the ideal avocado toast, with substitution options.

* 1 ripe avocado 
* 1 "Everything but the Bagel" ciabatta roll, available at [Trader Joe's](https://www.traderjoes.com/digin/post/everything-ciabatta-rolls)
  - I use 2 slices of whole wheat bread when I'm trying to be healthy, but the ciabatta roll is really the best bread for the toast. 
* 1 tablespoon Pepita Salsa, available at Trader Joe's
  - I've heard that people use sriracha mayonnaise or hot sauce instead. Personally, I am not a fan, but it might work for you.
  - I use Dash's Southwest Chipotle seasoning instead sometimes, or Trader Joe's Chilli Lime seasoning.
* 2 tablespoons crumbled feta (vegans - skip this)
  - Crumbled goat cheese works just as beautifully
  - Sometimes, I half the quantity of goat/feta cheese and add a thin layer of cream cheese to the bread instead. This is probably my favorite way to avocado toast.
* 1 teaspoon "21 Seasoning Salute", available at Trader Joe's
  - There's no real substitution for this, but you can use your favorite spice blend instead.
  


### Instructions:

* Toast the bread to your desired level.

* In a small mixing bowl, use a potato masher or a spoon to mash the avocado. 

* On a plate, place the two slices of bread. If you're using cream cheese, layer it onto the toasted bread. Add the mashed avocado, pepita salsa, feta/goat cheese, and seasoning in this order. Enjoy!
