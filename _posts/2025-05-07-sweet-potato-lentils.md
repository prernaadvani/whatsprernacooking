First post in nearly two years (!) to share my new favorite bowl!

The recipe that I used is adapted from [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021511-brown-butter-lentil-and-sweet-potato-salad)).

### Ingredients:

_Makes 2 serving:_

* ~1/5 lbs sweet potatoes, chopped into cubes
* 3 tablespoons butter (I used Earth Balance to make it Vegan)
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning blen
* 1.5 tablespoons Balsamic Vinegar
* 1 tablespoon maple syrup (or honey in a pinch)
* 1 15oz can of lentils, rinsed and drained
* ~1/3 cup parsley
* Handful feta or goat cheese (optional)
* Olive oil as needed
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

* Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Shake up your sweet potatoes in some olive oil, salt, and pepper. Lay the sweet potatoes out in a single layer on a baking tray, and bake for 20-25 minutes until tender.

* In a large pot, add the butter and let it heat up for a minute or two. Add ~1 tablespoon of olive oil and the Italian seasoning blend. Stir for a minute. Then add in the Balsamic vinegar and maple syrup. Mix for a minute. Then add the lentils and parsley. Continue mixing for a minute or two and then reduce the heat to low.

* Toss the cooked sweet potatoes into the pot and stir to combine. Add more salt/pepper if needed.

* Garnish with feta or more parley. Enjoy!
